# tech-blog-challenge-14

The Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and interact with other developers through comments. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and uses technologies such as Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and Express.js.

## About the Project
The Tech Blog provides a platform for developers to share their thoughts, opinions, and insights related to technology. Users can create an account, publish blog posts, comment on other posts, and interact with the community.

The project follows the MVC architectural pattern, separating the application into models, views, and controllers. The models define the database structure and handle data operations using Sequelize as the ORM. The views are rendered using Handlebars.js, a templating engine. The controllers handle the logic and routing of the application using Express.js.

## Features
The Tech Blog includes the following features:

* User authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the site.
* Homepage: Displays existing blog posts and provides navigation links.
* Dashboard: Allows users to view, create, update, and delete their own blog posts.
* Blog post page: Shows the details of a specific blog post, including comments and the option to add new comments.
